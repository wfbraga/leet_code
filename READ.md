# My LeetCode Journey 🚀

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This is a comprehensive collection documenting my journey through algorithmic problem-solving and continuous improvement.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository showcases my evolution as a programmer through LeetCode problems. For each problem, you'll find multiple solution approaches that demonstrate different stages of my learning process:

### 🎯 Solution Categories

1. **First Accepted Solution** 🟢
   - My initial working solution that passed all test cases
   - Often straightforward but not necessarily optimized
   - Represents my first understanding of the problem

2. **Self-Refactored Solutions** 🔄
   - Improved versions created through my own analysis and learning
   - Focus on better time/space complexity
   - Cleaner, more readable code
   - Application of new patterns and techniques I've learned

3. **AI-Enhanced Solutions** 🤖
   - Solutions proposed or improved by AI agents
   - Exploration of alternative approaches and optimizations
   - Learning from advanced techniques and best practices
   - Comparison with my own solutions to identify improvement areas
